        <h2>What is Instant Noodles</h2>
            <p>Instant noodles, or instant ramen, are noodles sold in a precooked and dried block with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil. The flavoring is usually in a separate packet, although in the case of cup noodles, the flavoring is often loose in the cup.</p>

            <p>The main ingredients used in dried noodles are usually wheat flour, palm oil, and salt. Common ingredients in the flavoring powder are salt, monosodium glutamate, seasoning, and sugar. The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, but air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries.</p>

        <h3>How to make instant noodles</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the water, all seasoning packets</li>
                <li>Drop in the noodles-Gently</li>
                <li>Fan it (<em>see below</em>)
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>This is critical</strong>: I find that simply boiling the noodles for 4-5 minutes, as most ramen directions read, produces a limp and soggy noodle. To avoid this, you have to slow down the noodleâ€™s cooking process while the broth continues to cook. The best way to do this: fan the noodles.flow of air will stunt the cooking process, which gives the noodles a slightly more al dente texture.</li>

                <li><strong>Noodle hacks</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li type="square">Drain the noodles to reduce salt, most of which is in the seasoning. Some of the fat may also be washed away.</li>
                        <li type="square">Throw away the seasoning sachet, use only some of it, cook in salt-reduced stock powder or plain water, or add non-salty flavourings during or after cooking.</li>
                        <li type="square">Use polyunsaturated or monounsaturated oils, or fat-free flavourings, instead of the palm oil sachet</li>
                        <li type="square">Miso paste, fish sauce and soy sauce add flavour, but can be high in sodium.</li>
                        <li type="square">Spice it up with sesame oil, sambal oelek, kecap manis, garlic oil, coriander leaves, mint, basil, sliced spring onions, fried shallots or a squeeze of lime.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
